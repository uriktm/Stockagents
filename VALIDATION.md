# üßê Verifying Agent Results

This guide explains how to manually verify the data generated by the **Stockagents** system to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Verifying `CorporateEventsTool`
* **What to check:** The upcoming earnings date.
* **How to check:** Go to a financial website like **Yahoo Finance** or **Google Finance**, search for the stock symbol, and find the "Events" or "Financials" section. The date should match the agent's output.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Verifying `VolumeAndTechnicalsTool`
* **What to check:** Trading volume, RSI, and MACD.
* **How to check:** Use a charting platform like **TradingView**.
    1.  Add the **RSI** and **MACD** indicators to the stock's chart. The numbers displayed on the chart should be very close to the agent's calculations.
    2.  Look at the **Volume** bars at the bottom of the chart. Visually compare the last day's volume to the average of the previous month to validate the `volume_spike_ratio`.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Verifying `NewsAndBuzzTool`
* **What to check:** The headlines and the sentiment analysis.
* **How to check:**
    * **Headlines (Objective):** Copy one of the headlines and search for it on Google. This confirms the NewsAPI connection is working and the news is real.
    * **Sentiment (Subjective):** This requires human judgment. Read the top 5 headlines presented by the agent. Does the sentiment score (e.g., `0.4` for moderately positive) and the summary narrative seem logical? This is a sanity check to ensure the AI is interpreting the news reasonably.
